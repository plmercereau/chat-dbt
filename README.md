# Chat-DBT

## TODO

-   `--confirm` option to prompt the user before executing the query
-   verbose level
-   output sql (on success) to file
-   output result to file
-   input from stdin / output to stdout (combined with the above)
-   nice to have (but complicated): when context is preserved, allow queries from previous data e.g. "translate the previous result into french"
-   implement the options into the web interface
-   web interface in dark/light mode
