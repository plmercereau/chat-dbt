# Chat-DBT

## TODO

-   `--confirm` option to prompt the user before executing the query
-   verbose level
    -   timestamps
-   `--hide-sql`
-   `--hide-result`
-   output sql (on success) to file
-   output result to file
-   input from stdin/output to stdout (combined with the above)
-   nice to have (but complicated): when the context is preserved, allow queries from previous data e.g. "translate the previous result into french"
-   implement the options into the web interface
-   web interface in dark/light mode
-   arrow up/down to get the previous queries
-   add CI tests for both the CLI and the web interface
-   changesets + publish
-   complete this readme
-   comment the code
-   add a `--model` option to let the user choose the OpenAI model
-   [x] spinner
